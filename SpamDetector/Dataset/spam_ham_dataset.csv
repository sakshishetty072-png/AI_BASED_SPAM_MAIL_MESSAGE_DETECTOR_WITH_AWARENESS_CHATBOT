ho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time ! 
i know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute . 
on the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about . 
i think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer . 
the first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past . 
the second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide . 
email me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! ) 
have a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !

please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from may 2000 and may 2001 . there are two tabs , one tab contains the days may 16 - 18 , 2000 and the other tab contains the days may 14 - 18 , 2001 . each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question . the days most directly comparable are may 17 , 2001 ( thursday ) and may 18 , 2000 ( thursday ) , although the two days preceding may 18 , 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding may 17 , 2001 . the peak on 5 / 17 / 2001 , 44 , 923 mw , is 2 . 78 % higher than the peak on 5 / 18 / 2000 , 43 , 709 mw . with similarly warm days before 5 / 17 / 2001 as there were before 5 / 18 / 2000 , the peak would obviously have been even higher . this would put the year - over - year growth in excess of 3 % . i believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year - over - year from an earlier analysis , somewhere in the range of 3 . 5 % to 4 % .

reasons to consider mogi : 
1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul |

2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on

made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even 
quadruple returns . 
breaking news ! ! 
april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its 
sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and 
road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig 
was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m 
well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in 
compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well 
immediately there after . 
the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion 
of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . 
with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and 
gas has prepared a detailed project description . 
project history 
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and 
has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil 
and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , 
predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field 
remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and 
expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . 
the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major 
oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an 
exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m in 1958 and was 
abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely 
eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company 
did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the 
complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the 
deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the 
west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in 
the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as 
mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more 
specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral 
rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil 
and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . 
through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered 
this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since 
that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres 
( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % 
of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in 
5 - 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . 
land discussion 
our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and 
northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 
acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling 
spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 
acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the 
province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units 
( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s 
satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased 
well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has 
been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering 
pekisko oil we will down space as well . 
geological discussion 
pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and 
associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the 
sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the 
pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was 
influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying 
this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the 
mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable 
shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and 
account for billions of barrels of reserves . 
production facilities discussion 
this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas 
over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering 
and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been 
constructed . 
a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our 
project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed 
drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is 
approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , 
excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in 
the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . 
this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the 
transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of 
red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get 
oil product to the transportation system . 
for more detailed project description please see news release dated 
( fri , apr 29 ) . 
good luck and successfu | trading . 
conclusion : 
the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known 
companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are 
already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for 
you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch

subject : gap certificates 
hey guys , i finally found one that is true ! i went down to the 
gap myself and redeemed my gift certificates already ! ! ! i sent 
enough e - mails to get over two hundred dollars worth of clothes from 
the gap ! you know , with all the crap sent over the mail , it is good to 
know that something finally rings true in this environment of virtual 
deception . send it to everyone you know , and you too can have a whole new 
wardrobe , courtesy of the gap ! isn ' t it grand ? 
hi ! my name is janelle mccan , founder of the gap . 
you have probably heard about the e - mail from abercrombie and fitch offering 
twenty five dollar gift certificates to every five people you sent that 
letter to . my question is : did it work ? most of you who tried it will 
probably say no . 
but this letter is not prank like others you have experienced . i am offering 
thirty five dollar gift certificates to every seven people you send this to . 
when you have finished sending this letter to as many people as you wish , a 
screen will come up . it will tell you how much you have earned in gap gift 
certificates . print that screen out and bring it to your local gap store . 
the sales clerk will give you your certificates and you can shop baby ! this 
is a sales promotion to get our name out to young people around the world . 
we 
believe this project can be a success , but only with your help . 
thank you for your support ! 
sincerely , 
janelle mccan

3439,ham,"Subject: new enrononline functionality 
in order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of enrononline we are rolling out several changes tonight , which will be in effect on monday august 20 , 2001 . some of these changes will affect stack manager while others affect the website . a summary of these changes is listed below . 
stack manager changes 
top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . 
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . 
please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out . 
restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a "" top of stack entry "" it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website . 
in order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as restricted top of stack "" option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the "" allowed "" option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the "" restricted top of stack "" feature . 
advanced filtering ability on all products tab - drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the all products tab in stack manager . in order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title . a drop down box with a list of attributes will appear . highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter . to turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" all "" option from the drop down box . 
website changes 
new submission screen for restricted top of stack limit orders - the submission screen for products that allow top of stack or restricted top of stack limit orders is as follows . 
the submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction , while the button on the right will submit as a limit order . in case of the restricted top of stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box . 
price of limit orders 
modify limit orders 
customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order . in order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on at the top of the "" today ' s orders "" section . the price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product . once the price is at the desired level click the "" set "" button and the price will be modified . another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order . you will see a box with plus , minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order . 
expiration time for limit orders 
customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days . currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours . 
float the today ' s orders section 
you can now float the "" limit order "" section . in order to do so , right click in the "" today ' s orders "" section and select the float window option . in order to make the window "" stay on top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option . 
mid market client - mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers , while including their desired margin on the trade , on enrononline products . in order to do so click on the bid or offer price , a customised submission window will appear . select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit . for example if a customer wants to buy nymex sep 01 at 3 . 36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin , please enter 3 . 36 as the desired price and 0 . 01 as the margin . the system will trade the order when the enrononline offer for nymex sep 01 is at 3 . 35 , book the trade at 3 . 36 and record the 0 . 01 origination amount . 
in order to be set up to use this functionality . please call the enrononline product control group . 
changes to website passwords - as an added security measure , which has been requested by many customers , some new password rules have been instituted . first , the password cannot be equal to the login id . second , each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days . these rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users . 
please note stack manager changes will be available all traders as of monday august 20 , 2001 . the changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded monday night , and external users by the end of the week . over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords . 
if you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713 - 853 - 1787 .

recap of pg & e texas meeting 4 / 12 / 00 . 
volume issues : 
? sherlyn schumack will provide stacey neuweiler with volume variances by day 
and contract as soon as possible ( preferably the same day allocation is 
received ) . 
? stacey will notify sherlyn of correct volume or status if further research 
is necessary as soon as possible . 
? sherlyn will notify logistics , stacey , and lorraine of pg & e texas of 
interconnect variances by day . 
? each group will respond promptly to ensure payment can be made through the 
system , eliminating manual line items on invoice . 
? charlotte hawkins will see what was confirmed on the outstanding 
interconnect issue for 2 / 00 , and daren or charlotte will make the necessary 
correction . 
rate issues : 
? heidi withers will pull daily rates from pg & e texas bulletin board . 
? greg steagall will provide heidi with service verification ( s ) and the daily 
allocation summary received from pg & e texas during close , which shows rates 
from pg & e texas . 
? no action will be taken on rate variances where pg & e was paid per their 
invoice . heidi has talked with brenda herod , and brenda is okay with this 
course of action . 
? there are four invoices from 1999 production where pg & e was underpaid , so 
heidi and greg will work to correct those months to pay pg & e correctly . 
there are no open invoices in settlements . 
? it was noted that manual line items are not to be used to pay pg & e per 
their invoice in the future . we expect to correct issues in the system prior 
to the due date of the invoice unless there is a valid disagreement between 
ena and pg & e . if ena has a valid disagreement , we will pay per ena  , s 
verification . 
daren has put in a request for legal to transfer the ena transport contracts 
to hpl . this would eliminate stacey having to schedule the transport on ena 
as well as the desk to desk deal . it would also prevent sherlyn from having 
to allocate the transport expense contract and the brokered desk to desk 
deal . 
he has not had a response from legal yet .",0

hi , 
the number is 281 - 370 - 7838 . 
i did not think of it , but without the pipe one has to balance ones own , doesn ' t one . of course the major problem was the people with hpl , not the counter - parties . who ' s doing that for you guys ? 
jen came home for the memorial day weekend so we just bummed around . saw pearl harbor , watched a few dvd ' s , and ate way to much . 
when you get time let us know about your "" bad luck "" . i hope jake wasn ' t helping you too much . 
i have been occupying much to much time with our new sound system . we finally chucked our little bookshelf unit and got a pile of yamaha stuff coupled to an equally large stack of klipsch speakers . awesome is the only word to apply . i ' m sure the neighbors are loving the old people next door . ( it ' s a young couple with a baby ) ( not near as nice as the other young couple i know ) . 
rumbling their walls at all hours just makes me feel good . : ) 
stock market still sucks , but as long as it pays for groceries and taxes we ' ll be ok . 
i ' m off to get linda ' s gas guzzlin , environment ruining , suv washed and buffed . then i must re - stock my cd - r ' s and load up on some more music . you can see how well i ' m utilizing my time in doing productive things .

yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses . 
the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts . 
we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services . 
ken 
dear ets colleague : 
on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy . 
in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved . 
the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business . 
beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas . 
over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !

that sounds great . because of the accrual , i cannot draft this today . i 
will try it on monday . what about the demand fee for the payable to tenaska 
iv . do you think that is a good idea ? i explained it to kris hanson and she 
agreed that it was the best way to book this payable . we would need a new 
demand purchase ticket for tenaska iv on the cleburne desk in the amount of 
$ 2 , 803 , 586 . 41 with no volume and no commodity . this is more than we owe 
tenaska iv , but i will net it with the tenaska iv sale and the $ 0 . 04 demand 
fee to pay a net amount of $ 1 , 551 , 050 . 76 . i have attached my spreadsheet 
which details our payment . we will have to adjust this number once we get 
the actual volumes . i would like to pay tenaska iv next week , so please let 
me what you think .

the below people , according to our records , are currently in your groups . these candidates have been identified as they have completed at least one relevant rotation and / or have performed well in the previous prc . prior to contacting the below analysts & associates , i want to ensure your buy - in / recommendation of these candidates . all selected candidates would be formally interviewed by the origination management team ( both gas & power ) prior to joining the program . 
i would be grateful for your early response as we are looking to schedule a date in november to commence interviews .

darren , we had a situation in december that we need your help to resolve . 
deal # 125836 we have been purchasing gas from cox exploration on pg & e 
hydorcarbons systems upstream of the processing facility . this purchase 
agreement terminated 11 / 30 / 99 . i didn ' t path the gas on pgeh , however , i 
will take responsibility for not adjusting the interconnect ticket at 
thompsonville . i didn ' t catch this and the deal on the hpl side appeared to 
be a valid flow issue for kim vaughn . the plant continued to confirm this 
gas . 
we have tried working through the pipeline , but they state that they will not 
know anything until the 15 th . can you contact the producer and ask them to 
reverify this with the pipeline ? i would like kim to be able to zero confirm 
and send back to pops so volume management will not allocate up to the 
producer level . 
also i just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at 
the same meter with tribo production . should there have been an expected 
volume in this deal ? is it possible that cox exploration sold their interest 
in this well to tribo . it may turn out that we should have flowed the gas 
after all .",0

dear friend , 
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do 
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the 
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was 
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through 
network online hence decided to write you . 
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm . 
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on 
diplomatic 
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual 
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five 
hundred 
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed 
the 
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does 
not know 
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes / 
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons . 
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries 
and 
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland . 
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe 
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white 
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing 
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the 
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of 
people 
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was 
one 
of 
the victims . 
it is against this background that , all my family members fled 
zimbabwe 
for fear of our 
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort 
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late 
husband ' s 
money to a more 
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the 
money is not being used , 
lying in the security company . 
i must let you know that this transaction is 
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents . 
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our 
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to 
be done to finalize all the arrangements with 
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after 
reaching a workable agreement with you . 
barrister hope martins law chambers , 
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm 
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear 
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in 
the 
custody of the diplomatic firm . 
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the 
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with 
your advice 
this matter require maturity and trust . 
regards , 
mrs . juliana mbuluku

will be contracts with several fortune 500 companies

of only 10 . there are less than one million shares in

lauri , from a legal standpoint , we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion . the contract clearly gives us 
this right . i haven ' t specifically reviewed the contract , but i am assuming 
it is our standard form . i will check this . 
yes , i would consider hisd facilities to be state facilities . the fact that 
this goes to entex first complicates the issue . 
dan , was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities , or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities ?

gerald / eric - 
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract 
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various 
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then , 
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are 
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ? 
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the 
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ? 
thanks for your help .",0

subject : basin production from ga 213 
i have reviewed the gas composition analysis from spl of the basin production 
from ga 213 . while spl ' s analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
f at 400 psig , it is both my and john handley ' s opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken . we expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher . however , this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time . we have conferred with steve 
schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days . once the 6 "" line has been pigged , the production flows 
stablilized and mitchell ' s conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days , hms will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have spl run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis . should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees f , then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed . in the meantime , hms needs to keep a close 
watch on all southern union city gates on galveston island to monitor for 
liquids fallout .",0

gary : 
hpl received volumes at the above meter during 1 / 1 / 99 thru 6 / 99 . prior to 
1 / 1 / 99 , ena was purchasing some of the volumes from i p petroleum under 
contract # 016 - 44386 - 102 ; deal # 341832 . this deal expired 12 / 31 / 99 , but the 
volumes continued to flow and be allocated to i p petroleum by pioneer . 
since there was no deal to cover these volumes , these volumes were allocated 
to hpl strangers gas contract .

3605,ham,"Subject: zero path termination in path manager 
matt / ben : 
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times . 
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination . 
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month . 
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume 
is on that path in the future month . 
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl 
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the 
scheduler when you are ready . 
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to 
paths for oba tracking .

refurbs save cash ! why hesitate getting the best 
value by getting the exact same equipment , with original 
manufacturers warranty at a much lower price . 
q : 
what 
is considered factory refurbished ? 
a : there are lots of 
things that can label items factory refurbished . some are so 
frivolous , its laughable . but because consumer laws prevent 
manufacturers from selling anything considered factory refurbished 
as "" new "" , the second consumer gets the best deal . here are a few 
examples : 
manufacturers / 
distributors are not allowed to export outside their territory / 
country . 
to avoid 
"" disturbing "" the dealer / reseller channel in different 
countries , manufacturers and distributors cannot export the 
product , as new and therefore label it as refurb . 
most major retail 
superstores offer a 30 - day money back guarantee on their 
products and there are those consumers that just simply take 
advantage of that . these items are returned to the manufacturer , 
inspected and repackaged like new . 
items where the 
box or casing was damaged in shipment , which are returned to the 
manufacturer . 
the item was 
returned to the manufacturer because of a slight defect . the 
part that was defective was replaced by the manufacturer , tested 
and then repackaged just like new . 
the item was 
returned because of a minor cosmetic blemish on the casing that 
was corrected . 
demonstration 
units are also considered factory refurbished . these units are 
inspected , tested and repackaged . 
the box was simply 
opened . thats it ! 
brand new 
overstocked items are also labeled factory refurbished . 
all factory 
refurbished products are inspected serviced by the 
manufacturer then tested and repackaged to meet original product 
specifications . all 
merchandise is warranted by the original manufacturer

minnesota , which can clinch a wild - card 
playoff spot with a loss by either carolina or st . louis this weekend , appeared on 
its way to retaking the lead . but a holding penalty on birk - - the vikings were 
flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that 
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning . 
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t 
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season . 
government spokesman raanan gissin 
said four soldiers were killed . 
six people were taken to hospital - - 
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military 
sources said . 
the sources said another soldier 
remained beneath the rubble . 
gissin said rescue operations were 
continuing sunday night . 
the attack "" indicates that unless 
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist 
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards 
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the 
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""

immediately known . 
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said 
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called 
the fatah hawks . 
there was no immediate information 
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah 
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . 
israeli military sources said it was 
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the 
post when the explosives were detonated . 
it was not clear whether there were 
palestinian casualties . 
news video of the aftermath showed 
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely 
wounded . 
in a pamphlet distributed after the 
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of 
the incident . 
palestinians have used tunnels in the 
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack 
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard 
an israeli tank shell exploded in a 
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , 
palestinian medical and security sources said . 
the children between the ages of 6 
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . 
the violence happened in khan yunis 
in central gaza 
israeli military sources said that 
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells 
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . 
in response , the forces fired towards 
the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military 
sources said .",1

george - i ' ve done some t - accounts ( the bean counter in me ) and i think the following is the best way to handle this going forward : 
change the existing deals , 547201 and 591307 , to a zero price . this will eliminate the a / r balance on hpl ' s books for glo , but will keep the volume nom ' d to glo and will not impact ua 4 . 
enter a ticket on hpl for a sale to ena for the value of the gas that was zeroed out on the above tickets . this should be entered as a demand charge only and the amounts should be $ 974 , 144 for 1 / 01 and $ 766 , 304 for 2 / 01 . 
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book purchases the demand from hpl . the amounts would be the same as in # 2 above . 
enter a ticket on ena where the ena - wellhead book sells demand to egm for the value of the crude oil for the prior month . for 1 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 886 , 638 . 60 ( the 12 / 00 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . for 2 / 01 , the sale would be for $ 839 , 008 . 29 ( the 1 / 01 crude oil delivered to egm by glo ) . 
this will require the following steps be taken monthly as this deal goes forward : 
the price on the sale from hpl to glo will need to be zeroed out monthly . 
the demand charges on steps 2 and 3 will have to be updated to reflect the value zeroed out . 
the demand charges on step 4 will have to be updated to reflect the value of the crude delivered to egm . 
once this is done , the a / r balance for glo will be cleared , the margin will be on the ena wellhead book , and the intercompany transactions will move the money from egm to hpl . this needs to be done monthly prior to flash , which will prevent any oa variances . the index for the gas value is available shortly after the lst of the month , and since the volume is firm , there shouldn ' t be a problem calculating the value . we should also know the value of the crude oil so that we can flash the sale from ena to egm . if you have any questions or see a better way to do this , please let me know . thanks .

from actual press releases : yjycunv 
red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone 
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john 
figliolini , president of atlantis business development 
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf 
dear shareholder , addlrko 
i am writing to you today to 
discuss the new direction which your company will be 
heading . up until this point we made it clear that 
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of 
the market . our basic premise was to seek out 
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow 
businesses with the proper equity investment made into 
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ; 
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we 
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant 
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the 
various projects they are currently working on . 
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see 
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and 
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has 
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of 
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir 
last week we announced that abdv 
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to 
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) , 
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start 
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in 
locating and provide managerial , accounting and 
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil 
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft 
you may ask ; why the energy 
related field ? simply it currently offers many 
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching 
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth 
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted 
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak 
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis 
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem 
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand 
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this 
year alone , most of which is because of china . the 
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the 
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30 
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented 
in stone . there are more players in the world economy 
today that require oil gas to propel their own 
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at 
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself 
with individuals that have experience in the energy 
field . these individuals will help locate viable 
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate 
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira 
so what do we do with our 
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein 
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will 
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses 
until they are at a level where they can move on their 
own . i believe that both of these companies will be 
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at 
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of 
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our 
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the 
basic premise of our business module whereby we share 
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing 
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue 
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhkmblmcewrw 
by concentrating on a specific 
sector such as the energy area we will be able to 
define abdv ' s purpose and guide it like a laser . our 
goal will be to locate and make investments in no less 
than four energy - related businesses over the next 12 
months . i believe that by maintaining this focus an 
investment in abdv will be looked at as an innovative 
way to participate in the booming oil gas and 
energy - related fields . twqssqlqqkvbdm

george , 
there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize 
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan 
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the 
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded 
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete 
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips 
measured prelim numbers for feb . 
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they 
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform 
us of any abnormalities that you see tommorrow . 
thanks

dtomi , inc . ( dtomi or the 
company ) markets a unique air spring suspension system , airspring axle , that 
allows small to medium - sized trailers to be lowered to near flush with the 
ground , greatly improving the safety and ease with which heavy cargo can be 
loaded and unloaded 

over 2 million small to medium 
sized trailers are sold annually in the us . 
these trailers are priced up to and over $ 5 , 000 , 
and are marketed to rental agencies , home - improvement retailers that maintain 
rental fleets , and individuals who need to haul heavy items such as contractor 
equipment , motorcycles , snowmobiles , jet skis , cars and horses . 

management estimates that the 
initial market for the company ' s air spring axle system is $ 10 - $ 15 million . 
there are thousands of trailer rental locations in the us , and the system can 
improve customer satisfaction , safety and labor requirements . dtomi is working 
with a leading home improvement conducting a four - month test of 50 trailers . 

the total market will grow to 
$ 140 million as the system is licensed to trailer manufacturers . 
dtomi plans to assist manufacturers with 
integration of the air spring axle system into existing trailer designs , and to 
collaborate with them on marketing efforts . management expects licensing fees of 
$ 200 - $ 300 per trailer .

positive by the end of 2004 . an 
aggressive multi - media marketing effort is underway , and rental fleet sales and 
licensing revenues are expected to bring high margins . the company recently 
raised approximately $ 1 . 3 million in equity capital .

expected to ramp up very quickly , and the company expects to be cash flow 
positive by year - end 2004 

dtomi 
raised approximately $ 1 . 26 million in equity 
financing through december 2003 , management expects that this cash will cover 
all important rollout operations and support the commercialization of the air 
spring axlet until breakeven is reached . 
the

the 1992 census indicated that there are 
approximately 15 million small and medium sized trailers in the u . s . , and that 
about one million units are sold annually . data from the leading trailer

subject : 24 x 5 products 
eric bass , texas desk trader , requested the following product described below 
be traded on enrononline . this product will not bridge into sitara and will 
have to be put in manually . 
the reason it will not bridge is due to the fact that it can have multiple 
stripes of start & end dates rather than one start & end date . currently , 
enrononline can 
only send one start & end date per deal therefore it will fail in the bridge 
monitor and will have to be manually entered into sitara & subsequently 
cleared out of the monitor . 
since these transactions could flow next day , it is imperative that these 
transactions get into sitara as soon as possible . please read the full 
description below . ( this product looks like a month long deal but excludes 
weekends . the "" wkd "" is short for week days . ) 
we do not anticipate a large volume of these transactions but need to be 
prepared to react quickly when they do . for the future , we are looking into 
the cost / benefit of enrononline having the capability of sending multiple 
dates for these types of products . 
if you have any questions , please call me at 3 - 5824 
thank you .

subject : 24 x 5 products 
we are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 nat gas product commencing tomorrow , 
may 24 th . 
the product is a month - long physical nat gas product traded off the texas 
desk . it will be identified as follows : 
us gas phy exxon katy wkd juno 0 usd / mm 
this product is different from the usual products traded on the texas desk in 
that the product description has an 
indicator of wkd , which designates that the product only moves gas on a day 
that is a monday , tuesday , wednesday , 
thursday or friday . 
these products will not bridge into sitara . risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these products based 
on the information in the product description to ensure that the products are 
entered into sitara correctly ( presumably - 
strips of monday - friday trades and the corresponding month - starting days 
and / or month - ending days ) . 
we understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate 
systems personnel to examine the links between eol and sitara and consider 
building bridge capability . in the 
interim , we anticipate that the trading volume on these products will be low , 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the 
bridging in the event that volumes increase .

today we released additional information about our related party and off - balance sheet transactions . we have made this information available both on our website and in a form 8 - k filing with the securities and exchange commission ( sec ) . 
the information provides further details about : 
- - the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to shareholders ' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge ; 
- - a restatement of prior years ' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders ' equity , the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications ; 
- - the special committee appointed by the enron board of directors to review transactions between enron and related parties ; 
- - the ljm limited partnerships , including a discussion of transactions between enron and ljm entities ; and 
- - transactions between enron and other enron employees . 
this information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec . as our board ' s new special committee continues its review of various matters , we will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in its investigation , and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate , appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . 
restatement of earnings 
based on information that we have recently obtained , enron and its auditors determined that certain off - balance sheet entities should have been included in enron ' s consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles . as a result , enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001 . these restatements have no material effect on enron ' s current financial position . here are some details included in the filing : 
net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of joint energy development investments ( jedi ) and chewco beginning in november 1997 , the consolidation of an ljml subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments . enron ' s current assessment indicates that the restatement will include : 
- - a reduction of approximately $ 96 million in 1997 
- - a reduction of approximately $ 113 million in 1998 
- - a reduction of approximately $ 250 million in 1999 
- - a reduction of approximately $ 132 million in 2000 
- - an increase of approximately $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
- - an increase of approximately $ 5 million for the second quarter of 2001 
- - a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 . 
the consolidation of jedi and chewco also will increase enron ' s debt by approximately $ 711 million in 1997 , $ 561 million in 1998 , $ 685 million in 1999 and $ 628 million in 2000 . 
the restatement will have no material impact on enron ' s reported earnings for the nine - month period ending september 2001 . 
you can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the form 8 - k filing at . 
we will continue to review our strategic , operational and financial position , and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments .",0

flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that 
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .

sources said . 
the sources said another soldier

there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist 
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards 
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the 
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . "" 
shortly after the first blast , a 
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not 
immediately known . 
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said 
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called 
the fatah hawks . 
there was no immediate information 
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah 
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . 
israeli military sources said it was 
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the 
post when the explosives were detonated . 
it was not clear whether there were 
palestinian casualties . 
news video of the aftermath showed 
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely 
wounded . 
in a pamphlet distributed after the 
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of 
the incident . 
palestinians have used tunnels in the 
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack 
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard 
an israeli tank shell exploded in a 
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , 
palestinian medical and security sources said . 
the children between the ages of 6 
and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . 
the violence happened in khan yunis 
in central gaza 
israeli military sources said that

good day , 
i am kingsley muntu , decillion finacial services south africa . this is an urgent and confidential business proposition . 
on june 14 , 2000 , a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation , 
mr . alan baker made a numbered time ( fixed ) deposit for twelve calendar 
months , valued at us $ 8 , 320 , 000 . 00 , with us . upon maturity . i sent a routine 
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . after a month , a 
reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers , 
global oil corporation that mr . baker passed away . 
on further investigation , i found out that he died without making a will 
or a testament , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . i also discovered that mr . baker did not declare any kin or 
relations in any of his official documents , including his deposit paperwork 
in my possession . this has been fixed under our management . no one will ever 
come forward to claim it . 
consequently , my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand 
in as the beneficiary to this investment . i am writing to you because i 
cannot operate a foreign account . i want to present you as the beneficiary 
of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney . 
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney 
prepares the necessary documents , which will put you in place as the 
beneficiary to this investment . 
please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this 
transaction will be of mutual benefit , as you will be entitled to 30 % of the money and the remaining 70 % for my own investment . if you are 
interested , reply me by email for further details . 
kind regards ,

this is a statement that was read over the pa system at the football game 
at roane county high school , kingston , tennessee by school principal jody 
mcloud , on september 1 , 2000 . i thought it was worth sharing with the 
world , and hope you will forward it to all your friends . it clearly shows 
just how far this country has gone in the wrong direction . 
"" it has always been the custom at roane county high school football games 
to say a prayer and play the national anthem to honor god and country . 
due to a recent ruling by the supreme court , i am told that saying a prayer 
is a violation of federal case law . 
as i understand the law at this time , i can use this public facility to 
approve of sexual perversion and call it an alternate lifestyle , and if 
someone is offended , that ' s ok . 
i can use it to condone sexual promiscuity by dispensing condoms and 
calling it safe sex . if someone is offended , that ' s ok . 
i can even use this public facility to present the merits of killing an 
unborn baby as a viable means of birth control . if someone is offended , no 
problem . 
i can designate a school day as earth day and involve students in 
activities to religiously worship and praise the goddess , mother earth , 
and call it ecology . 
i can use literature , videos and presentations in the classroom that depict 
people with strong , traditional christian convictions as simple minded and 
ignorant and call it enlightenment . 
however , if anyone uses this facility to honor god and ask him to bless 
this event with safety and good sportsmanship , federal case law is 
violated . 
this appears to be inconsistent at best , and at worst , diabolical . 
apparently , we are to be tolerant of everything and anyone except god and 
his commandments . 
nevertheless , as a school principal , i frequently ask staff and students to 
abide by rules which they do not necessarily agree . for me to do otherwise 
would be inconsistent at best , and at worst , hypocritical . i suffer from 
that affliction enough unintentionally . i certainly do not need to add an 
intentional transgression . 
for this reason , i shall , "" render unto caesar that which is caesar ' s , "" and 
refrain from praying at this time . however , if you feel inspired to honor , 
praise and thank god , and ask him in the name of jesus to bless this event , 
please feel free to do so . as far as i know , that ' s not against the law - 
yet . "" 
and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held hands 
with one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayed 
in the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayed 
in the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supreme 
court of the united states of america - the seat of "" justice "" in the one 
nation under god . 
somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . we 
are given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion . 
praise god that his remnant remains ! 
let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001 
jesus said , "" if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before my 
father . "" 
- - - - - - - - - 
if you are not ashamed , pass this on . . . but only if you mean it . 
yes , i do love god . he is my source of existence and savior . he keeps me 
functioning each and every day . without him , i will be nothing . without 
him , i am nothing but with him , i can do all things through christ that 
strengthens me . phil 4 : 13

hey joe , 
here ' s the response i got with regards to tomcat . i ' ve place another call 
into david and let him know that the information we received included most 
points except for tomcat . i ' ll keep you informed . 
what i know is that the gas is sourced at mi 587 and moved on km ' s firm 
contract . for as long as ces remembers , they sell the gas to entex . entex 
chooses the pipe off which they take - - usually midcon - - also , hpl channel , or 
tejas . km is invoiced directly . volume is approx . 2395 . the deal with entex 
is written up monthly . km pays on a basket of indices . entex pays on the 
highest index .

329,ham,"Subject: hgpl and kgpl - 3 rivers gas 
based on the conversation we had at the meeting last thursday , i am 
implementing the following changes to humble gas pipeline and king ranch gas 
plant . if you disagree or feel you had a different understanding than the 
items below , please be sure to call me asap . 
1 . input hplc purchase from hplr liquids at meter 8793 ( hpl / hgpl ) . remove 
the 3 rivers gas from the interconnect ticket and input on 
the purchase deal . 
2 . input hplc sale to hplr liquids at meters 9643 ( kgpl / hpl ) and 12 
( kgpl / hgpl ) . remove 3 rivers volumes from the interconnect tickets 
at these meters and input on the sales deals appropriately . 
3 . change swing parameters for the king ranch contracts to swing on cage 
ranch before swinging on 3 rivers gas . this will hopefully allow 
the sale for 3 rivers gas to remain at one meter as much as possible . 
i will hopefully have all of these changes made by the end of the day , and 
have all contracts repathed . it is my understanding that we are implementing 
these changes effective feb . lst . 
stella , this may or may not effect repathing of the hplc gas at meter 9643 , 
based on the swing parameters that you have been using .

rick , 
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv . 
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future . 
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena . 
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management . 
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

i would think that the first contract should go the aep . ena won ' t be selling to equistar 
off of channel for at least three months . ena will have to get a transport agreement with 
hpl or channel . 
on the second contract : is hpl making the sale or ena ? is it a sale that is going 
to aep . i know we are serving a small entex point off of oasis . is that for convenience , 
can hpl sever the point some other way ? 
someone let me hear what you think .

i spoke with daren and there are a few contracts that he was aware of : 
1 . channel - 012 - 15600 - 02 - 069 ena using hpl ' s capacity - selling to equistar on channel 
2 . oasis and pgev - hpl is using ena ' s capacity 
3 . tejas ship and tejas gas - daren says we don ' t do business often on these pipes as ena , but we always have the possibility that we will at any time , so ena would need it ' s own transport contracts

sandi , 
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week . 
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on cpi . 
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do 
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you 
guys mentioned that it would be tied to an index - - could you restate for me 
how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater 
of the volumes nominated through the supply contracts or the actual 
deliveries to the plant . then the fee will vary month to month ? year to year ? 
based on what index ?

tenaska iv has been operating without a "" gas agency agreement "" since that 
portion of the transition agreement expired on august 31 . we met with sandy 
and the texas gas desk on september 28 to firm up commercial terms ( which i 
think we generally accomplished for all matters other than the price that 
would be charged by the desk ) . should we be concerned with the amount of 
time this is taking ? that is , is there any risk we face ( bank - wise or 
otherwise ) during the period of time before this agreement is inked and taken 
through the bank consent process ?

george , 
gary called me about this shut in situation a few minutes ago , specifically 
regarding meter 6722 . this meter is at the tailgate of three rivers , 
therefore , an hpl field employee will not be able to contact the producer 
( they probably have no idea where the gas is coming from that goes through 
this meter ) . 
gary suggested that the deal maker contact these producers verbally , and then 
connie sutton will follow up with written notice . per our discussion , since 
mary jo and gary are out this afternoon , i am forwarding this message to you . 
the concerned contracts are : cody texas , lp , 012 - 64365 - 101 , 96018049 and

here ' s the latest global performance management schedule for ye 2000 and some 
friendly reminder tips for you and your direct reports . the system is

nov . 20 th prc meetings begin 
dec . 15 th prc meetings conclude 
jan 4 - 5 th executive committee meeting 
reminders 
request that employees maintain an updated list of their acheivements and 
contributions to your group . tell them the information they forward to you 
will better help you in representing them . 
the focus of the prc this year will remain on development of the employee and 
will emphasize comparing everyone within a particular peer group relative to 
everyone else in their peer group . 
update your documentation of employee performance and communicate the key 
highlights of their performance or lack thereof now with your direct reports 
so that the evaluation process creates minimal or no surprises for your 
direct report . it is much easier to have a constructive evaluation session 
with your direct report if he / she already knows what the key areas of needed 
development are . an ideal situation for the supervisor is one in which 
employees with performance issues ( can ' t do or won ' t do ) choose to exit the 
group voluntarily before the self evident evaluation has to be given . 
i will continue to provide updates and reminders as they become available . 
let me know if you have any questions .

2386,ham,"Subject: texoma - beaumont hpl maintenance 
this is in regard to the maintenance that you want to do at the texoma - 
beaumont interconnect ( replace some valves , i believe ) . 
we had discussed doing this at a time when mobil beaumont refinery would have 
low gas takes . that window of opportunity will be in early to mid february . 
mobil will take down some of the units at different times during the month . 
some of these units are endothermic , some are exothermic , so in some cases 
their gas load goes up when they take certain units down . but based on the 
schedule of ups and downs that i ' ve been given , it looks like their gas load 
will be at a low point between february 1 and february 12 , at somewhere 
around 50 , 000 / d . last we talked about hpl continuing to deliver 20 , 000 / d 
through the low pressure meter , and delivering the rest through centana . is 
this still the plan ? ? 
we met with mobil last year in july to talk to them about what we need to 
do : that it would take less than a day , and that during that time , hpl would 
deliver some of our gas to them through the centana meter . but that meeting 
was a long time ago , and we might need to meet again - you know how 
conservative 
one thing of concern : in the past two months , we have effected some of our 
midcon delivery obligation by delivering 30 , 000 / d gas in kind to mobil 
beaumont . so we will not be able to do this during the day that we do our 
maintenance . 
once you gents let me know what you game plan is and confirm how we ' ll handle 
gas flows while we do our work , i ' d like to be the one that initially tells 
mobil of our plans and set up the initial meeting . it ' s going to take a lot 
of coordination because i can guarantee you that mobil ' s maintenance schedule 
will change !

investor alert newsletter - april issue issue 2005 
gbic is set to soar this monday ! 
in april ' s issue we are going to profile a stock that is very much undervalued 
and has just started trading . ground floor opportunity for everybody . 
this small treasure is : gbic ( gulf biomedical corp ) 
the stock is trading at only 20 cents and we expect it will hit 50 - 60 cents in 
the second week of april 
huge pr campaign expected this week so grab as much as you can up to 45 - 55 cents 
range

current price : $ 0 . 19 
we expect the price to go to 50 - 60 cents in next 2 - 3 days 
we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks . 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
there are some very positive news expected next week so act before that : ) 
about the company : 
60 - million americans are losing - or have already lost - their hair . they are 
mostly men , but also a substantial number of women . most of that 60 - milloin wish 
they had it back . gulf biomedical corporation ( gbic ) has a breakthrough product 
that will help them . no , it will really help them . 
there are thousands of products and services promising to do the same thing , 
until you read the fine print . the fine print says , "" this doesn ' t work for 
everybody . "" it says , "" results may take four months or more to appear . "" it says , 
"" beware of the side effects . "" it says , "" a long term contract is required . "" 
gbic has hairmagict . there is no fine print . hairmagict says , plain and simple : 
"" hairmagict grows hair . easily . painlessly . inexpensively - for less than $ 2 a 
day . results in 4 weeks , or your money back . "" 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

we expect the price to go to 80 cents in next 2 weeks . 
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
the product : 
the product is hairmagictand it grows hair . no , it really grows hair . how 
important is that ? 
an estimated 60 million american men and women ( yes , women too ) are losing - or 
have already lost - their hair . most of them would give anything to have it 
back . people do ridiculous things to look like they have hair when they really 
don ' t . funny ? sure , if you have a full head of hair . if you don ' t , you would 
probably pay any amount for something that could actually grow hair on your 
head . 
that ' s what the experts call a "" market ! "" 
now , you ' ve seen all the ads . they are full of hair - growing promises , plus 
warnings that their product doesn ' t work for everybody , and beware of the side 
effects . one promises the buyer will see results , if any , in four months . all of 
them cost a veritable fortune . 
now , finally , there ' s a hair - growing product that actually grows hair , and 
hairmagict guarantees to start doing so in 4 weeks or less , or give you a 100 % 
refund . and , incredibly , hairmagictsells for less than $ 2 a day .

this meter has not been disconnected . the measurement tech turned in a 
temporary disconnect to mips ( about 2 months ago ) because the meter has not 
flowed for approximately 4 months . this allows the measurement tech to forgo 
testing the meter until it is ready to be put back in service . scheduled 
volumes should be taken to zero until further notice .

october 2000 . because we did not know at the time what was happening with 
this deal , the demand fee was inadvertently paid to williams for sept . and we 
need to recoup our money . on apache deal 384247 , james thinks we need to 
remove the demand charge completely . he says it is not a part of the deal 
and apache is not billing us for it . we also need to talk about the pricing 
on both of these deals . williams and apache are billing us less than what we 
have in sitara . to be able to keep this desk at zero , jim pond does not want 
me to use pay the lesser of for the purchases , so we need to address the 
price differences . you said you had some contract briefs that supported our 
prices . please fax a copy to me at 713 - 646 - 8420 and i will compare them to 
what james has .

subject : re : koch midstream services co 
since koch has told you that they sold the properties to duke , i would say 
that duke should be paying us for the gas . 
i had heard that koch sold the properties to another counterparty , but i 
wasn ' t sure to whom . i either talked or left a message with someone in the 
settlements area about two months ago about this after koch informed the 
trader that they should not be getting the invoices . however , i never heard 
back from anyone . 
this is related to the ces acquisition which came online the first of this 
year . the deal info we had at the time had this sale booked to koch . i can 
change the tickets in sitara to the duke counterparty ( or create new tickets ) 
today if you need me to , so that we can get the invoice out the door . you 
will still need to coordinate with the contract group in getting the correct 
contract in place for the deal .

i have been billing koch midstream services co under ena for meters 
ll - 1 - 0030 - comitas ( sitara # 144052 ) and ll - 1 - 0027 - volpe ( sitara # 144049 ) . my 
former accounting contact at koch , michael thomas , said that koch sold these 
south texas assets to duke energy field services back in 1999 . michael faxed 
a contract which i forwarded to cindy balfour flannigan in the contract 
area . cindy said she can ' t tie the deals in the contract to our system so 
she can ' t recognize the assignment . cindy has left messages with koch , but 
she has not been able to resolve the issue . koch is refusing to pay for 
the gas and there is currently over a million dollars outstanding relating to 
these deals . i need to find out whether koch or duke is responsible for 
paying for this gas . do you have any information regarding this issue ?

tom , does your group have any dealings with acacia natural gas ? it ' s a texas intrastate owned by mitchell . they have made a filing for approval of section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their operating conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate ( priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement ) . 
would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so . comments are due on the filing by nov . 7 th , and if we want to protest , we ' ll have to get our facts together .

i have some information on the e - workorders ( ehurr and ehset ) that were set 
up to track the costs of bridgeline . apparently the workorders themselves 
were not set up correctly so no costs could be coded to them in msa . we have 
corrected the workorder set - ups and they should be working now . as for prior 
costs , i think we will be able to get a list of all the payroll costs that we 
attempted to code to ehurr and ehset , and then book an entry in april that 
would reclass them to the workorders . we would then be able to see all the 
costs associated with the project , as you wanted to do from the beginning , 
and code any future costs directly to the workorders . i will let you know 
more when i finalize that this can really be done , i just wanted to keep you

to all employees : 
this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses : 
- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner . 
- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing . 
- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion . 
- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline . 
these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so . 
as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer . 
for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination . 
i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions . 
when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities . 
on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .

controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres ( approximately 11 sq . 
miles ) in montana . another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and 
gold properties are controlled in bolivia , south america . ( source : 
company website ) currently trading at . 012 p 
possibilty of an absolutely huge week as massive pr campaign has 
started and is expected to last all week . pp 
imagine how well your portfolio would have done the last month or so 
if you had the scoop on the following stock : p 
( otcbb : mbah ) : this stock closed at . 01 on september lst . this 
little giant closed at . 06 on october 8 th , up 500 % in about 5 
weeks . do you think ibm is going to move like that anytime soon ? p 
as many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in 
price because they are promoted , making a very large number of 
investors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp 
let ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp . 
otc : dmxpp 
about the company : p 
delta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration 
company that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres 
( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all 
located over what management considers to be some of the most 
prospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states . 
another 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are 
controlled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed 
that the bolivian properties display similar potential to those 
found in north america . p 
the management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry 
rayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration 
company to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of 
experience in the field of geology , along with running some of the 
most successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was 
the president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a 
market cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated 
with glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp 
minerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector 
along with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an 
extraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company 
moves forward . p 
among the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30 
years experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa , 
south america and the united states . while with gold fields mining 
corp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent 
drilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p 
delta has experienced significant technical success since its 
start - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first 
in - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead 
kimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part 
of the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown 
the three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator 
minerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic 
diamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p 
an aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to 
discover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this 
under - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing 
kimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p 
in bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly 
prospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia 
group of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other 
one - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to 
the independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres 
comprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays 
all the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further 
exploration is justified . p 
delta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing 
its extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also 
by acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on 
identifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining 
companies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and 
finance additional exploration . p 
in addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta 
controls , they also control a gold property with great potential . 
the property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis 
revealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an 
extensive exploration program . pp 
( source : company website ) p 
recent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p 
delta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a 
conference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p 
delta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in 
preparation of work program . p 
delta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold 
exploration findings in south america . p 
delta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond 
exploration in south america . pp 
will dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of 
the stock this weekend and next week ? if you think so , you may not 
want to wait until it is too late . remember , timing your trade is 
critical . good luck and happy trading . pp

our cold box will probably not have feed into it until mid may at the earliest . 
this means that we will continue to have a large volume of refinery gas going to 
fuel . we are nominating the minimum of 80 bbtu / d knowing that we should start 
the month well short of the 80 with the volumes increasing as the month 
progresses and the cold box comes on line . call me if you have any questions .

in most cases , ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related 
to the cleburne plant . however , for october 2000 , the plant was down the 
majority of the month and ena sold off the supply , resulting in ena owing 
money to tenaska iv . 
i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , which is the 
calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk . ( please see the attached 
schedule . ) we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv . do we need to pay 
this amount ( wire from ena to tenaska iv ) or is there another way to do 
this ? this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in 
the future . 
greg , troy , jim - please let me know what you think about settling this . 
megan - don ' t pay the amount until we here from the greg , troy and jim . 
also , make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we 
reimburse tenaska iv .

we have actuals . the larger of the two volumes is 1 , 395 , 000 , which is 
45 , 000 / day , so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine . i am having a 
problem , though , with the way it is coming to settlements . it is showing up 
with a jan 2003 delivery date . i think the demand fee needs to be on 10 / 1 
only . right now , it is on a line with a date of 10 / 1 / 00 to 12 / 31 / 36 . i 
think this is confusing the system some how . also , we still need the 
purchase deal for tenaska iv . it should be for a demand fee of $ 2 , 571 , 135 . 73 
booked to the cleburne desk . we actually owe $ 1 , 798 , 389 . 73 , but i need to 
net the tenaska iv sales with the purchase to clear those receivables . james

sorry i ' m just now getting back to you . here are some answers to your 
questions . 
waskom is a field in east texas ( harrison county ) where we purchase gas from 
pennzenergy at the bryson c . p . and jeter # 2 wells . the gas is termed up to 
new 
waskom gas gathering ( nwgg ) through june 2001 ( the term of the pennzenergy 
purchase ) . we then buy the gas back from nwgg into our tetco east texas pool 
. . . also termed up through 6 / 01 . 
virginia field used to be associated with ngpl , but several years ago 
pennzenergy worked out a processing arrangement with corpus christi gas 
gathering , so the gas is now termed up with ccgm through 6 / 01 . . . priced off 
of 
the houston ship channel . 
jennings ranch used to flow into ngpl through a gathering line , but a couple 
of 
years ago ngpl sold that line to midcon texas , so we now handle it as another 
midcon texas property . sometimes we sell it at the meter to midcon texas 
( kn ) , 
and sometimes we ship it through midcon to our ngpl south texas pool . 
carthage : altra picks up their gas in their cartwheel agreement . the 
agreement we nominate on is also a cartwheel agreement . it is not much 
different than a hub agreement , except it allows title tracking . tgt on the 
whiteboard refers to texas gas . . . east ohio takes their gas into texas gas on 
a couple of different transport contracts . 
let me know if you have more questions .

35 , 000 in mops was pathed  ) transmitted nom to pops and confirmed . 
? costilla , meter 9687 was still down 4 , 000 due to wellhead production 
losses on friday , expected short into the first of the week , possibly longer , 
may need to fish the hole to bring the well back up . 
? costilla pilgreen  ) running high h 2 s , causing our valve to shut - in 13 , 000 
mm  , s ( we changed our specs at the valve to accept 8 parts per mil for 30 
minutes last week , per jill zively ) . louis dreyfus was diverting the well to 
another pipeline , per the contract that gas has to come to us or be shut - in . 
we got the well back on saturday afternoon , and all was well . 
? all meters were updated in pops for satuday  , s gas day . 
? christy w / pg shell lost two units . 
also , seeing meter 1394 which dels to shell back down from 10 , 000 to 5 , 000 .

? joey stanton with duke called regarding some new production coming up . he 
wanted to sell it into hpl at lonestar / katy for sunday and monday . paged 
darren , we took the gas , it needs to be priced today . duke let me know that 
they would flow at a rate of 25 , 000 / hour , and should average approximately 
12 - 15 , 000 for the day . mark mccoy is working on getting a good meter total

either there were deliveries off of centana that we are missing , or there is 
a problem with the hpl data . i am having brain fade and cannot remember the

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add 
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

mops . let me know what you find in mops .

subject : meter 984132 for 1 / 16 / 99 
here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 . 
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where 
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was 
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error 
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal ? 
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day 
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) . 
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated 
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be 
added to the deal .",0

hey guys and girls , 
? 
here ' s an idea for an icebreaker activity for our 2 nd week of neon . ? this is 
only an idea , you can use it or do something totally different . ? again , let 
me know along the way if you have something that has worked well for your 
group so we can share in the wealth . 
? 
someone in your group should have a couple of classic books full of 
icebreaker - game type of activities , building community in youth groups , and 
youth group trust builders . ? we all at one time had a selection of 
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still have somewhere in a 
drawer . ? spend time in the games and forced interactions , especially over 
the beginning of the semester . ? if you don ' t have these resources , let me 
know . ? even if some of these ideas may seem familiar to you , remember that 
you may have been doing this far longer than the oldest kids have been in 
your group . ? but again , if you have any ideas for resources let me know . 
? 
in addition to the ideas to think about at the top of the 2 nd weeks topic , a 
couple of additional thoughts given me by leaders : 
? ? ? - realize and possibly communicate in a low key manner to the freshman 
that their expectations of neon may not initially be met . ? they may be 
coming in with ideas of what neon is , only to possibly be disappointed . ? in 
a sense it is similar to going to a restaurant or movie after tons of people 
have recommended it to you , and being a little let down . ? more importantly , 
they need to realize that neon is not an event , it is a process . ? the teens 
who say they love it are most often the ones who have been in it long enough 
to have built relationships and to have shared a bunch of common 
experiences . ? with time and a commitment on their part to be at neon weekly , 
their expectations will ultimately be met . 
? ? ? - remember that the best quality time you have with the kids is probably 
before or after neon , or at other non - neon times . 
? 
have fun loving on your kids wednesday !

select the your rcs , and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver 
for the month of february . please fill out the attached activity driver 
survey with march numbers for your rc by end of day wednesday , april 5 th . if 
your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed 
data , please send the report to me , and put me on your recipient list

every month . if you would like us to collect this information from someone 
within your team beginning next month , please let me know . 
please take this opportunity to verify the following : 
1 . the driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to 
perform these activities for each commercial team . 
2 . the activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified 
( please let us know otherwise ) 
3 . if the activity is using an allocation ( for example "" allocate 0469 "" or 
"" 80 - 20 split "" ) , that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not 
changed from last month . ( please let us know if it has changed what the new 
allocation is ) . 
in reference to these surveys , please note : 
if you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams 
listed in the survey , please identify them . we will take your business 
support costs ( such as feedback , training , etc . ) and allocate them evenly 
among these teams .

this well is behind the big cowboy system . at this time , we have deal ticket 
380710 , purchase from ccgm , l . p . on hplc / hplc . this deal should probably be 
on gulf energy / bigcowboy . the producer , as i understand it , is acock

could we add the following phrase ( as shown below in red ) to the exxon katy location ? this is to reassure our customers that the delivery is in fact intrastate . please let me know if this is possible to do and if we have your approval .

the transaction is for delivery of intrastate gas at the tailgate of the exxon katy plant . notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the general terms and conditions , if applicable , this transaction is between counterparty and enron north america corp .

what is involved in changing a product description to include this phrase ? i do have some customers in texas that are legally bound to only trade intrastate gas and they are fearful of trading anything that doesn ' t specifically state that . 
since it is probably only a handful of customers , if it is a major production , it may not be worth it , but i wanted to check .

hi daren , 
bryan hull gave me your name . a customer was interested in trading intrastate gas and bryan had informed me that our exxon - katy location is intrastate . i was wondering if you would be interested in changing the long description on eol for this location to include the phrase intrastate gas so that any customers that are interested would be able to see that . if this is okay with you , i will forward it on to our product development team .

sandi , 
sorry for just now getting back with you . i was out last week . 
the rate ( $ . 04 / mmbtu ) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated 
on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant . the fee will 
be adjusted yearly based on cpi . 
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the 
delivered volumes ( actuals or nominations ) . i think we should use actuals 
due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a 
daily basis . we would receive the estimates / actuals on a lag and may have to 
purchase gas to offset the imbalance , even though the plant kept the noms at 
the 45 , 000 base . i also think that if the plant does increase the nom , they 
are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less . do 
you agree with this ?

when we met regarding the rate for the tenaska gas management agreement , you

how that is to work - - it will start out 4 cents per mmbtu based on the greater

i think i ' m younkger than main target group of cialdis consumers , but i 
have a very hard work , i always had to listen about people ' s failures , about bad life et cetera . 
all that problems affected my selxual activity , my wife was not as happy as before with me . 
i tried viagras - both genedric and pfdizer ' s , but they does not act as good and as long as i want it to be . 
finally , my colleague told me about cialdis and i ordered it . the results were really better , trust a doctor . 
i ' d recommend it to anybody with erectlion troubles .

i have changed the demand fee . but , is this adjusted by the dollar amount that we need to recoup from williams ? i don ' t want to pay tenaska until we get the money from williams . additionally , i believe that we need to keep the volume at 45 , 000 for the admin fee , since we originally nominated 45 , 000 / day .

subject : interconnect / intercompany issues 
below is a list of the major items that are still outstanding on the 
interdesk / interconnect report for 1999 and 2000 that is impacting the 
intercompany cleanup for sap implementation . these issues have been 
addressed in earlier e - mails and this is an updated list of issues that need 
to be completed by june 19 , 2000 . 
1 ) king ranch interstates - fred and stella are working with exxon to 
reconcile from oct 1999 - apr 2000 the interstate nominations for tennessee 
and ngpl and also for tejas . 
2 ) tetco meter 6892 - question of who has custody transfer at the meter . 
ena is using tetco ' s volume and hplc is using the hpl measurement volume , 
causing a desk to desk variance . 
clem and pat are working on . 
3 ) transco bammel meter 74 - transco and hpl ' s nominations are out of 
balance at meter 74 . charlotte needs to work with transco to resolve . 
4 ) dow meter 4486 - the sale to entex needs to be taken off of hplc meter 
4486 and the sale needs to be at dow meter 4486 . 
a desk to desk between ena ( buyer ) 
and hplc ( seller ) needs to be set up on dow meter 4486 . 
ami needs to set up the deals and 
thu needs to coordinate the months involved . 
once this is done and thu 
reallocates to dow pipeline , jackie needs to zero out the confirmed noms and 
make the meter non allocatable in pops . 
clem verified with steve schneider 
that this meter is not on hpl ' s system . 
5 ) east texas gas / devon - devon invoicing ena entire flow at carthage . 
meter 4607701 east texas keeping hplc whole on 
nominations 
desk to desk 
deal is out of balance because of this 
karen is working 
with pennzoil and east texas to reach agreement on how to handle this issue 
between them 
6 ) pgev - actuals on swing meters ( hpl ) not matching expense volumes being 
allocated by pgev . 
sherlyn is working with stacey and charlotte to resolve . 
7 ) pan energy sales issues - discrepancies on pgev . katherine and sherlyn 
are working with stacey to resolve .",0

if the plants become an external counterparty , the fee should probably go

the escalating fee .

how are things going ? just a note to reiterate what we talked about 
yesterday . rick hill wanted to know what the admin fee would be if the fee 
was for an outside counterparty . this admin fee would be for the life of the 
project ( through 2019 ) . also , mike mazowita should be calling you to talk 
about the plant being down this week through the end of the month . please 
let me know if you have any questions or concerns . thanks .

daren , 
i contend that a person should be given their birthday as a paid holiday . 
however , i know that the likelihood of your being off work during bid week 
is extremely slim . i hope that you have a great day anyway and a great 
weekend with your precious family . we ' ll give you a call this evening or 
over the weekend to extend our birthday greeting ( and so sally can sing to 
you ) . 
we are so looking forward to seeing you , tonya , cole and jake next weekend . 
we ' re disappointed that you will not be able to come until the weekend but 
are grateful that you are willing to share your family and allow them to 
come a few days early . we will certainly enjoy our visit with them . 
thank you for being the wonderful husband and best friend to tonya that you 
are . it gives sally and me such joy seeing tonya highly honored and loved 
by you . you are a wonderful father too and it ' s so apparent the bond of 
love that you enjoy with your sons . they watch your every move and hang on 
your every word . we ' re so very proud of you for being the spiritual leader 
of your family , for being such an outstanding provider for their every need , 
and for putting up with the "" outlaws "" . in addition to our friendship , i 
love you as my own son . again , happy birthday .

hi , 
i figured something must be occupying your time other than answering 
non - business e - mail . 
you guys must all be getting double salaries for doing 2 jobs each . - - - - 
right ? ( chuckle ) . 
if tom really lets you take the time off for the baby and if you really have 
the time ; lunch would be great . just give me a call . only if all the ifs 
really allow you the time . 
is craig ok ? ? i hope . 
i would be glad to help with your sprinkler system . my sharpshooter is older 
than you are , but i imagine it is built a little better . my requested wages 
for that sort of work would make renting a trencher very cheap for you . i 
would be happy to come by and keep an eye on the cold beer . that would be 
free of charge . 
i ' m having a cable modem installed monday . supposed to be 50 - 70 times faster 
than what i have . i do way to much jumping around to run off this slow modem . 
i can then dump my other phone line . actually will end up spending less for 
more speed . i love technology . 
thanks for the info on the stock option . that is the closing price as of 
1 / 18 / 00 , which is right before the jump . very nice of management . i like to 
know the number to see what might be affecting the price . 
well good luck on the extra job and give our best to tonya - - - - not much

hypothermia has set in .

i will pop the hood and stare at the engine as if i know what 
i ' m looking at . if another man shows up , one of us will say 
to the other , "" i used to be able to fix these things , but now

groceries at the store , like milk or bread . i cannot be expected 
to find exotic items like "" cumin "" or "" tofu "" or "" cardamom . "" 
for all i know these are all the same thing . 
because i ' m a man , when one of our appliances stops working 
i will insist on taking it apart , despite evidence that this will just 
cost me twice as much once the repair person gets here and 
has to put it back together . 
because i ' m a man , i must hold the television remote control 
in my hand while i watch tv . if the thing has been misplaced , 
i may miss a whole show looking for it ( though one time i was 
able to survive by holding a calculator ) .

don ' t think we should stop and ask someone . why would 
you listen to a complete stranger - - i mean , how could he 
know where we ' re going ? 
because i ' m a man , i do not want to visit your mother , 
or have your mother come visit us , or talk to her when she 
calls , or think about her any more than i have to . 
whatever you got her for mother ' s day is okay , i don ' t 
need to see it . and don ' t forget to pick up something for 
my mom , too ! 
because i ' m a man , you don ' t have to ask me if i liked the

because i ' m a man , yes , i have to turn up the radio when 
bruce springsteen or the doors comes on , and then , 
yes , i have to tell you every single time about how bruce 
had his picture on the cover of time and newsweek the 
same day , or how jim morrison is buried in paris and 
everyone visits his grave . please do not behave as if you

too . either pair of shoes is fine . with the belt or without it 
looks fine . your hair is fine . you look fine .

it apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12 / 99 -

therefore , vance explained to me that the volume of 1 , 517 dth for the period 
should have been allocated to the strangers agreement , just as it was . any 
deliveries were unauthorized ( udog ) and the gas then belongs to hpl . please

usa spends on prescription medications . today is 
your change to get in on these savings . 
click here for more details : 
the drugs that are available are 
* generic ambien 
* generic xanax 
* generic phentermine 
* generic vioxx 
* generic lipitor 
* generic nexium 
* generic paxil 
* generic viagra 
this is the best way to buy prescriptions

subject : re : exxon company , usa global # 96035668 / sitara # 212225 
i have re - checked sitara & verified that the above deal was a term , firm 
deal . this resulted in a gtc purchase firm contract being set - up in the 
global contracts system . the term of the gtc was set as the term of the deal 
( 4 / 1 / 00 thru 3 / 31 / 01 ) with no evergreen , meaning that the contract will 
expire at the end of this month . 
to the best of my knowledge , all gtc purchase firms have the same language & 
they do not have evergreen . they expire at the end of the primary term . 
so , unless exxon negotiated a deal with different , special language to allow 
for evergreen & included something about a "" 10 day notification "" to 
terminate , there isn ' t any reason to "" terminate "" this contract . 
if this is the case , please advise . otherwise , i don ' t think we need to do 
anything . the contract will expire at the end of this month on its own .

subject : tenaska iv 
rick , 
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv . 
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future . 
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena . 
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management . 
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

donna and i researched your list and identified the ones that were on system

standard pooling stations and west texas ( line x ) pooling stations had no

this is a follow up to the conversation you had with pat yesterday and to 
reiterate retro contract assignments . we have decided to go back to the old 
process of handling contract assignments mid - month . this means that if we 
receive an assignment from legal after the 10 th workday , that assignment will 
become effective for current month the following month . for example , if i 
receive a notice from whomever that xyz has been assigned to abc on 11 / 15 / 00 
for an legal effective date of 4 / 00 , i will create a new deal from 4 / 00 
forward . on the new deal the currect month will be zeroed out under the 
expected volumes . bob would not start nominating this new deal until 12 / 00 , 
leaving 4 / 00 - 11 / 00 to be moved by volume mangement . 
if this is not a clear understanding from all parties , please let me know .

will readdress this issue .

i have no problem sticking around with the group , it is a compliment and i am glad that you all appreciate what i have been able to contribute to the group . i just want your opinion on something . 
one of my many goals while a part of the analyst program is to become a senior analyst or third year analyst . it is a promotion that also brings with it a bit of a pay increase . in no way do i want to imply greed , or that i will only stay for money , but if in your opinion i may be deserving of this , then maybe we could run it by bob or the program , or whoever is in control of that . 
just a thought , let me know what you think .

in regards to meter 098 - 4179 the following information is what i have been 
able to determine from the information available to me . 
to your questions : 
1 . cannot determine who owns this meter . i will contact molly carriere on 
monday when she returns . 
2 . hpl has a fifty ( 50 ) ft . easement at this location which does contain 
language for appurtenance rights within the 50 ' . 
3 . i pulled the meter file for this location which was prepared during 
project rock and it does not contain a facility agreement so i am assuming 
one was not located . 
hope this helps .

attached is a contract preparation request for a facilities agreement for the 
coastal oil the 
legal department has prepared and is currently circulating a ratification and 
consent to assign document to reflect this transaction . 
we have been unable to locate an existing facility agreement for the 3 
previously drilled wells and suspect that no such agreement exists . 
the facility agreement requested herein is intended to cover only alterations 
to be made to existing meter 098 - 4179 to install an h 2 s monitor and necessary 
valving to allow hplc to accept gas from the newly drilled albrecht # 4 well . 
once the h 2 s monitor has been installed and the albrecht # 4 well is ready to 
flow , we intend to paper the purchase of gas from the albrecht # 4 well only 
via a spot confirmation pursuant to a spot gtc . the albrecht # 4 will not be 
covered by 96008903 , nor will the wells currently subject to 96008903 be 
subject to the spot gtc . 
coastal will reimburse hplc $ 39 , 600 for the cost of the installation .

we intend to attempt to connect about 4 , 000 mmbtu / d of new production from 
the newly drilled coastal oil in may , 2000 , the meter flowed about 960 
mmbtu / d of 3 . 36 % co 2 gas . 
the content of the albrecht # 4 gas according to the field gas analysis 
prepared by coastal oil the albrecht # 4 h 2 s content 
is similar to that of the three wells currently producing 960 mmbtu / d behind 
meter 098 - 4179 , the miller - albrecht unit # 1 - a and the hoff heller gas unit 
# 1 a & # 2 d . coastal further purports that for some time now it ( and / or its 
predecessor , mjg , corp . ) has treated these three wells for h 2 s in a manner 
sufficient to reduce the h 2 s content delivered into hplc to permissible 
levels . coastal has further indicated that it intends to reduce the h 2 s 
content of the albrecht # 4 to permissible levels before delivering same to 
hplc . in your opinion , should coastal be forced to install an h 2 s monitor 
for this new gas prior to flowing same to hplc ?

good afternoon everyone , 
i would like to present megan jones for consideration of the sr . specialist 
position ( job 103143 ) 
as for your essential requirements , she meets and exceeds them all . 
accounting degree from ut , very detailed , knowledge of the gas industry , 
excellent communication skills , and over 2 years of experience . 
regarding essential functions , she could perform them right away . her 
resume shows detail of experience . 
megan left coral energy to get into a department at sonat which would 
provide her more of a challenge . she was truly being utilized as a 
"" bean - counter "" and wanted more interaction with others . she went to work at 
sonat which she says is the best job she ever had . she enjoyed the company , 
people , everything . . . as you know , sonat was bought by el paso which ended 
her position along with others in her department . 
she honestly took her current position in haste , but also thought it would 
give her the experience of using her accounting skills , but having more 
interaction with others in an audit capacity . this has not been the case . 
she misses the industry , and learns quickly , very social and has no problem 
interacting with people at all levels . 
let me know your thoughts and any questions you may have . 
best regards , 
sharon

what does mops show for the days in question ? it would be incorrect to add 
any days to the adonis ticket mentioned below . it sounds as if the meter was

here is the issue for 1 / 16 / 99 at meter 984132 . 
20 , 000 mmbtu were confirmed for adonis in pops . 10 , 000 mmbtu on day 5 and 
day 16 . day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 ( track id 6155 ) , which is where 
10 , 000 was confirmed . the actual sale to adonis was 10 , 000 which was 
invoiced and paid by adonis . we are trying to clear the feedback error 
report . my question is why was 10 , 000 confirmed on 1 / 16 / 99 if the date is 
not valid for the deal ? 
when karen allocates the actual 10 , 000 it is prorating 5 , 000 for each day 
that is confirmed ( the 5 th and 16 th ) . 
should the whole 10 , 000 be allocated to the 5 th or should 5 , 000 be allocated 
to each day ? if 5 , 000 should be allocated to each day , the 16 th needs to be 
added to the deal .",0

daren - thank you for the list of the true , remaining ena sales customers . i 
have been researching your list & getting the contractual volumes that brenda 
needs . i am confused about praxair though . 
the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 . 
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial 
agreement . 
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it 
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to 
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

subject : ena sales on hpl 
i am working on a project for brenda herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking . 
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena & 
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to 
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is 
doing off of hpl ' s pipe . 
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity 
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will 
this give me everything that i need ? 
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in 
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas 
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - - 
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ? 
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas / suggestions / help that you can offer ! ! !

that is not what is on ray ' s schedule , so we are still out on the

subject : entex transistion 
the purpose of the email is to recap the kickoff meeting held on yesterday 
with members from commercial and volume managment concernig the entex account : 
effective january 2000 , thu nguyen ( x 37159 ) in the volume managment group , 
will take over the responsibility of allocating the entex contracts . howard 
and thu began some training this month and will continue to transition the 
account over the next few months . entex will be thu ' s primary account 
especially during these first few months as she learns the allocations 
process and the contracts . 
howard will continue with his lead responsibilites within the group and be 
available for questions or as a backup , if necessary ( thanks howard for all 
your hard work on the account this year ! ) . 
in the initial phases of this transistion , i would like to organize an entex 
"" account "" team . the team ( members from front office to back office ) would 
meet at some point in the month to discuss any issues relating to the 
scheduling , allocations , settlements , contracts , deals , etc . this hopefully 
will give each of you a chance to not only identify and resolve issues before 
the finalization process , but to learn from each other relative to your 
respective areas and allow the newcomers to get up to speed on the account as 
well . i would encourage everyone to attend these meetings initially as i 
believe this is a critical part to the success of the entex account . 
i will have my assistant to coordinate the initial meeting for early 1 / 2000 . 
if anyone has any questions or concerns , please feel free to call me or stop 
by . thanks in advance for everyone ' s cooperation . . . . . . . . . . .

finally ! 
i have always worried about the size of my penis . when i have sex , 
even though she says that the sex is good , i know that what she really 
wants is an extra inch ! 
3 months ago i found the extender . i just put it on whilst i ' m driving 
the car and when i ' m sleeping . it stays hidden under my clothes and it 
is really surprisingly comfortable and soft . 
i could tell that my penis was getting longer and heavier , but i 
thought that when i took it back off i would shrink back to original 
size . i was really surprised ! 
i have been 4 . 5 long since adolescence 
when i took off the extender i was measuring 6 . 5 
after not wearing the extender for a week , i am still 6 long ! 
the lengthening is permanent ! 
i could not believe the results of this device . i am back to wearing it 
again and i ' m still getting larger ! my girlfriend says it is the best 
product i ' ve ever bought , and she always reminds me to put it on if i 
forget ! 
take a peek . . . we know it works . there ' s a total guarantee with it , too . if 
you are not completely satisfied with your length gain and comfort you get your 
money back . every penny . no - one sends them back ! 
the extender correct the curve of the penis too , straightening out sharp bends 
as new cells grow !

there is no way to undermine the devastation and loss we ' ve all 
witnessed and felt over the last couple of weeks , but when you look at the 
following numbers and realize how much worse it could ' ve been , i guess there 
are a lot of people who were saved . . . 
subject : the odds are against them 
by now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise 
and reports of the 
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the us . 
these were deplorable 
acts 
that we will never forget . but now is a time to look 
at the other side of 
the 
numbers coming out of new york , washington and 
pennsylvania . the sad 
but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream 
media has not reported yet 
- the survival rates and some positive news about 
the attacks . 
* * * the buildings * * * 
* the world trade center - 
the twin towers of the world trade center were 
places of employment for 
some 
50 , 000 people . with the missing list of just over 
5 , 000 people , that means 
90 % of the people targeted survived the attack . a 
90 % on a test is an ' a ' . 
* the pentagon - 
some 23 , 000 people were the target of a third plane 
aimed at the pentagon . 
the latest count shows that only 123 lost their 
lives . that is an amazing 
99 . 5 % survival rate . in addition , the plane seems to 
have come in too low , 
too early to affect a large portion of the building . 
on top of that , the 
section that was hit was the first of five sections 
to undergo renovations 
that would help protect the pentagon from terrorist 
attacks . it had 
recently 
completed straightening and blastproofing , saving 
untold lives . this attack 
was sad , but a statistical failure . 
* * * the planes * * * 
* american airlines flight 77 
this boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of 
the pentagon could have 
carried up to 289 people , yet only 64 were aboard . 
luckily 78 % of the seats 
were empty . 
* american airlines flight 11 
this boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people 
aboard , but only carried 
92 . 
thankfully 74 % of the seats were unfilled . 
* united airlines flight 175 
another boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people 
only had 65 people on 
board . fortunately it was 81 % empty . 
* united airlines flight 93 
this boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting 
stories yet . the smallest 
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out 
of a possible 289 had 
84 % of its capacity unused . yet these people stood 
up to the attackers and 
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a 
national landmark , saving 
untold numbers of lives in the process . 
* * * in summary * * * 
out of potentially 74 , 280 americans directly 
targeted by these inept 
cowards , 93 % survived or avoided the attacks . that ' s 
a higher survival rate 
than heart attacks , breast cancer , kidney 
transplants and liver transplants 
- all common , survivable illnesses . 
the hijacked planes were mostly empty , the pentagon 
was hit at it ' s 
strongest point , the overwhelming majority of people 
in the world trade 
center buildings escaped , and a handful of 
passengers gave the ultimate 
sacrifice to save even more lives . 
pass this information on to those in fear and the 
media . don ' t fear these 
terrorists . the odds are against them .

2648,ham,"Subject: flow change for fuels cotton valley redeliveries into hpl 
saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for 
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this 
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change 
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200 
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur 
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance . 
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the 
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton 
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star 
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being 
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in 
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and 
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not 
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after 
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are 
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy 
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in

dear friend , 
it is with a heart full of hope that i write , soliciting for your 
strict confidence in this transaction . this is by virtue of its nature 
as being confidential and top secret . i feel quite safe dealing with 
you in this business proposition , having gone through your remarkable 
profile on the internet . though , this medium ( internet ) has been greatly 
abused , i choose to reach you through it because it still remains the 
fastest , surest and most secured medium of communication . however , 
this correspondence is official and private , and it should be treated 
as such . i also guarantee you that this deal is hitch free from all what 
you may think of . 
i am an accountant with beagon nigeria , ltd . foreign oil company based 
in lagos , nigeria . beagon was involved in prospecting , drilling and 
bunkering of oil at high sea ( offshore ) , with expatriate consisting 
majority of the staff strength . unfortunately , these expatriates got 
into an illegal sale of oil and the money from it transferred through a 
security company out of the country but with a security stamp on it . 
the federal government of nigeria discovered the illegal deal , and 
revoked their license and the expatriates were repatriated . so , by 
virtue of my position as the accountant of the company , i have in my 
possession the documents containing information about the trunk box 
deposited with the security company . the content of this box is thirty 
two million united states dollars ( us $ 32 m ) . 
i have put in an application with the security company to transfer the 
box to their correspondence office abroad , which they have obliged .

1223,ham,"Subject: new version of stack manager 
introduction 
in response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we have 
upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we 
hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your 
products . 
this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days . 
please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade . 
summary of new features 
multiple children - a "" child "" product can be the "" parent "" of another child 
( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placed 
against a single parent . 
static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar and 
hit the "" + "" or "" - "" button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amount 
in product properties until you logout . 
sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on 
the title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your "" shift "" key . 
parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis 
relationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : "" basis 
link - parent "" and now would say "" stand alone , parent "" ) . 
detailed feature descriptions 
multiple children 
the new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together 
in a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent product 
b , which is in turn linked to parent product c . 
warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a 
chain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when a 
customer attempts a transaction , the database must "" lock "" each and every 
product in the chain before it can process the transaction request . the 
database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the 
locks . "" vertical "" chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) are 
much slower to process than "" flat "" chains ( one parent with many children ) . 
large vertical chains should be avoided . 
related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the 
same parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parent 
product b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis link 
to the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopated 
basis link and a regular basis link . 
static product bar prices 
the new version of enrononline provides for "" sticky "" product bar price and 
volume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does not 
reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you 
have logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads or 
offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the "" + "" or "" - "" buttons . 
one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it 
reduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , if 
the price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the price 
movement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across the 
website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harder 
for customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price update 
moves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . entering 
an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price 
movement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary , 
improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure 
rate . 
you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new field 
for offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for products 
which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu . 
sorting / selecting 
the new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting 
functionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type , 
location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiple 
sorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and then 
location while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted first 
by product type and then within each product type , by location ( in 
alphabetical order ) . 
if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sort 
criteria , plus you can select "" sort by web order "" , which allows you to see 
your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the 
website ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing a 
number of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) . 
when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the left 
mouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key while 
making your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are not 
necessarily adjacent to one another . 
parent products and f / x products 
one of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its 
treatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed the 
type of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left of 
the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new version 
does not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows for 
more than one type of link on each parent product . 
some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are now 
identified with a stylised "" fx "" in the product list . this is to enable easy 
identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the 
parent , rather than managed individually . 
assistance 
as always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality , 
please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 ) 
20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) . 
general feedback 
if you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for further 
functionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you had 
previously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into this 
release , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hard 
to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your 
requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .",0

lacy got her eye exam yesterday . he said that she is very near sighted , but the diabetes has not affected her eyes at all . that was a relief . she ' s been having headaches , so i was concerned . they probably have been from her blood sugars being out of control . she is doing so much better now . i have stopped waking her up to check it in the night & the levels are so much better . she ' s acting a lot more like her old self now . a lot nicer to me . i guess her sugars out of control & all the stress of tiger dolls was what was wrong with her . she doesn ' t say the cruel things to me that she used to . i knew something had to be wrong with her . i thought surely i had not raised a child with such a mean spirit . anyway things are a lot better .

553,ham,"Subject: fyi - new product on eol 
just so everyone is on the same page : 
based on jennifer and dale ' s discussions with eric bass , a new "" tokenized 
period "" will be set up in eol . the intent of this period ( quick overview ) is 
to allow for gas flow monday through friday and no flow on the weekends . 
this will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments . 
it is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using eol , the trade itself ( with 
multiple monday - friday , no flow during weekend periods ) cannot be handled 
internally by eol . just as eol is not able to handle this trade , the sitara 
bridge from eol cannot handle this trade . because of this , there should be 
heighten attention by trade capture given to the eol bridge monitor . these 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually . 
an effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications ( eol and 
sitara ) on how a deal with multi - periods can flow without human 
intervention . this has not been started . in the meantime , a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually . 
how do i know that a particular deal has multi - period flow ? once the eol 
product has been set up , jennifer and / or dale will let all involved know . 
the person ( s ) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the eol product ' s delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly . 
for example , assume that a deal has been traded for april : 
four delivery periods ( separate lines ) should be included in the sitara 
ticket 
start : 04 / 03 stop : 04 / 07 
04 / 10 04 / 14 
04 / 17 04 / 21 
04 / 24 04 / 28 
each delivery period ( line ) should have the same pricing 
remember to enter the eol deal number when creating the sitara trade . 
also remember that paths created in unify assume the stop date is open 
ended . every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path ; otherwise 
the number of reconciling items will increase . 
please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted . 
any concerns , please contact sheri thomas or myself .

daren , 
we are working with mark mccoy on getting some things repathed in the 
system . it appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in unify 
just the deliveries - not sure why ? ? ? ? . we have been paying the suppliers 
based on whatever they invoice us for , which typically has been a smaller 
number than what we have in unify . also , we have not been able to get a 
contact for the allocation statement . in some cases , we get the summary 
sheet , but no detail and some months we don ' t get anything at all . do you 
know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on 
a timely and consistent basis ? the contacts on the allocation statements 
that we do have are not returning phone calls . i also need to know what was 
the beginning balance when we took this on for tenaska ? anything else that 
we need from you , i will call you .

i have had several discussions with daren farmer and below are a few questions remaining . 
ann mag - which plant does this gas come into or out of ? daren farmer indicated that ngpl / trunkline is connected to la gloria ( agua dulce ) and tenn / coral / shannel are connected to the gulf plains plant ( agua dulce minus ) . do we have an option on which plant tailgait we would like delivery ? if so daren said we would prefer the gulf plains plant . 
oakhill - are all three at the carthage hub ? if so , then the texas desk will give a quote , probably hsc minus , otherwise the east and central desk will need to quote the volume into tetco and koch mid , respectively . 
vaquillas ranch km - what plant processes this gas ? 
white heron - where is this ? could not find it on the map and daren was not familiar with this field . 
sheridan field - daren assumed this was the shell sheridan plant , but he wanted to verify with you . 
hungerford north - where is this ? 
bear den - where is this ? 
moore ' s station - where is this ? 
dan hughes - hpl is quoting this volume ( as well as several other field connected to hpl ) and they need a meter number for this field . 
we have one less day to get these quotes than originally anticipated because of friday being "" good friday "" and basically all of the 32 nd floor being out , myself included . 
so , let me know via voicemail or email what you can find out regarding the above questions . the properties we do not have any questions on are currently being quoted up , or will be tomorrow morning .

there is a new version of stack manager which is being released this evening , 
for use on monday morning . 
changes 
1 ) "" inactivate suspended children "" - new menu item available by 
right - clicking on a parent product . it will change all child products of the 
highlighted parent from "" suspended "" to "" inactive "" . note that this will be 
applied only to the product which you highlight . it will also show available 
when highlighting products which are not parents , but it will have no effect . 
2 ) the transaction list has been amended to correctly display only those 
transactions completed on the calendar day ( problem has affected australia 
and singapore ) . 
3 ) a constant spread which is changed from the front page of the stack 
manager will stay as changed for that product . the spread will persist even 
if transactions occur . 
background 
suspended child products continue to have their prices updated as the price 
of the parent changes . inactive child products do not have their prices 
updated . the price update process slows down enrononline processing and stack 
manager response , so it is advantageous to ensure all non - active products are 
in an inactive state . 
if you have any questions on the above , please contact the enrononline call
