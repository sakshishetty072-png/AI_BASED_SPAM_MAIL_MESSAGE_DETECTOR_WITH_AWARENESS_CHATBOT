# 📧 AI Based Spam Mail & Message Detector with Awareness Chatbot

## 📌 Project Description
AI Based Spam Mail & Message Detector with Awareness Chatbot is a machine learning-powered web application developed using Python and Streamlit.  

The system detects whether an email or message is **Spam or Not Spam** and also includes an awareness chatbot that educates users about cyber safety, phishing attacks, and online fraud prevention.

This project combines **Machine Learning**, **Text Processing**, and **User Interaction** to provide both detection and awareness in one platform.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User logs into the system.
2. User enters an email or message.
3. The text is cleaned and preprocessed.
4. The trained machine learning model predicts whether it is Spam or Not Spam.
5. The awareness chatbot provides cybersecurity guidance and prevention tips.
